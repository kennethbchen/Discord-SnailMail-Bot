# Discord SnailMail Bot

This Discord bot simulates the act of sending and receiving letters as if they were sending physical mail using a postal service.

## Features

Users can register with the bot and link with other users to enable sending and receiving letters to each other.

Users can write and send letters to other users, and those letters will be delivered after a certain amount of time (typically days) has passed to simulate the real world transit of mail.

The receiving user can check their mailbox and read any letter that was delivered to them.
